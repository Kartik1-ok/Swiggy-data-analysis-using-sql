# Swiggy-data-analysis-using-sql
Performed comprehensive SQL-based data analysis on Swiggy’s customer, order, restaurant, and delivery datasets to extract actionable business insights. Executed complex queries to evaluate customer behavior, restaurant performance, delivery efficiency, and revenue trends. Enhanced skills in advanced SQL, data querying, and report generation.
Purpose and Scope
Skill Application: The study serves as a comprehensive exercise in advanced SQL query writing, featuring complex joins, aggregate functions, grouping, and filtering.

Business Insights: Through querying the Swiggy database, the analysis surfaces key operational metrics valuable to the business, such as customer activity, restaurant performance, delivery partner efficiency, and city-wise trends.

Real-World Context: Every query and insight is aimed at mirroring decision-making processes and intelligence gathering in a real-world food delivery business.

Key Analysis Areas
The project covers a diverse set of queries including:

Identifying customers by city (e.g., all customers in Delhi)

Calculating average restaurant ratings in Mumbai

Listing active customers (those who’ve placed orders)

Ranking customers by number of orders placed

Computing total revenue per restaurant

Finding top 5 restaurants by customer ratings

Flagging customers who’ve never ordered

Drilling down into orders from specific cities (e.g., Mumbai)

Reviewing orders placed in a specific period (e.g., last 30 days)

Pinpointing delivery partners’ activity levels

Detecting customers with consistent ordering behavior (e.g., on exactly 3 days)

Recognizing delivery partners with widest customer reach

Uncovering customer pairs with shared city and restaurant preferences, but who ordered on different dates

Learning Outcomes
Advanced SQL Proficiency: Participants enhance their SQL capabilities by writing, optimizing, and interpreting complex queries.

Business Intelligence: Analysts learn to draw actionable insights to improve customer engagement, restaurant partnerships, and delivery logistics.

Data-Driven Decisions: The project highlights how structured data analysis can improve strategic operations in online food delivery.
